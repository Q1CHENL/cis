# Introduction

## Electricity as a Commodity

- cheap: elastic price close to marginal cost
- easy: complexity of power grid is hidden
- interoperable: any device fits into any socket

## Cloud

### Promises

- cost savings: capex, opex
- scalability
- elasticity: pay what you need
- resource decoupling: pay for storage and compute separately
- expertise
- high-level services: no procurement, installation or administration
- flexibility: get a virtual server with 5 clicks
  > Cloud revenue is constantly growing over years

### Reality

- high cost
- vendor lock-in
- transition from open source tech to proprietary services
- limited control
- unpredictable performance
  -> Cloud is a fundamental shift for computing: changes, confusion and opportunity
  -> Major shift in software design and engineering
  -> Utopia vs. Dystopia
